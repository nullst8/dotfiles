All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

If yes, then the Copyfish free OCR software is for you.\n\nCommon reasons to extract text from images are to google it, store it, email it or translate it. Until now, your only option was to retype the text. Copyfish is soooo much faster and more fun.\n\n“Images” come in many forms: photographs, charts, diagrams, screenshots, PDF documents, comics, error messages, memes, Flash – and Youtube movies.\n\nYou can verify the results in one glance with the extracted text overlay.\n\nDo you need to switch between OCR languages often? You can define \"Quick Switch\" buttons for up to three languages on the settings page.\n\nFor language learners: There are many translator addons available, but they only work with plain website text. Text inside images, in tricky Javascript/AJAX or, especially, in movie subtitles on Youtube or Youku is unreachable for them. But not for Copyfish. And if you want, Copyfish also translates the text for you. Especially for the subtitle translation use case, Copyfish has a repeat feature. Mark the area of the subtitle once and then use the \"Do OCR\" button to grab the latest text from the movie screen.\n\nDesktop screenshots and desktop OCR: To use the desktop OCR feature you need to install the free UI.Vision XModule, too. Copyfish it uses it to take and display desktop screenshots inside the web browser. This is for the new desktop OCR feature. Of course, you only need to install the UI.Vision XModule if you want to extract text from the desktop. Typical use cases for this are grabbing text from desktop apps, popup dialogs, images of all kinds, invoices, PDF,... . For more details on this feature, please see https://ocr.space/copyfish#desktop\n\nFor extension gurus: You might have heard of Project Naptha, a great addon that applies state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms on every image you see while browsing the web. Copyfish solves the same problem, but it takes a different user interface approach. It does not try to alter the website. Instead, it lets you mark the text in the image you want to extract. As a result Copyfish works with every website, even videos and PDF documents.\n\nFor developers: Copyfish is published under the GPL open-source license. As OCR software, it uses the free OCR API from https://ocr.space/ .\n\nQUESTIONS? SUGGESTIONS?

LocalCDN contains these frameworks/libraries in add-on storage. This is the reason why the size of LocalCDN is 10 MB. There is also a donation page and a short FAQ page inside the extension. There are only external connections in the form of hyperlinks that the user must actively click on. This includes, for example, the test page or the translation platform \"Weblate\".

Allow potentially malicious web content to run only from sites you trust. Protect yourself against XSS other web security exploits.","fullDescription":"Winner of the \"PC World - World Class Award\" and bundled with the Tor Browser, NoScript gives you the best available protection on the web. It allows JavaScript, Flash, and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice (e.g. your banking site), thus mitigating remotely exploitable vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown.\n\nIt protects your \"trust boundaries\" against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), cross-zone DNS rebinding / CSRF attacks (router hacking), and Clickjacking attempts, thanks to its unique ClearClick technology.\n\nSuch a preemptive approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and unknown!) with no loss of functionality where you need it.
